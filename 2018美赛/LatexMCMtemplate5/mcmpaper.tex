\begin{abstract}
In this article, we aim to evaluate the development of energy of four states (Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas) and set goals for the future development through data analysis and modeling.


Firstly, we consider five aspects (the source of the energy consumption and its proportion, output and the proportion of renewable and clean energy , end usage composition and proportion, energy prices and the total energy consumption, population and energy consumption per capita), the related data processing, in the form of, to describe the energy profile of each state. Based on the ordinary least square method, we found Tendency Description Model and analyze the trend of the energy development. We also interpret the result in the following aspects: population, economy, climate, energy policy.


Secondly, after considering several factors which are the most important in the energy profiles, we implement the AHP method to weight these factors and then apply the TOPSIS method to evaluating the energy profiles of the four states. We conclude that in 2009, Arizona has the "best" energy profile.


Then, on the basis of the energy profiles, considering that some other factors (such as the natural environment, population, climate ) that also affect the energy profiles, we select 7 other index to make the profile more complete. We take 5 years as a forecast period, and found the ARIMA model and the Tendency Extrapolation method to forecast the value of the 7 index, so that we can describe the development of energy profiles in 2025 and 2050..


Finally, by using the standard of the evaluation model, combining the criteria of the "best" profile with the forecast data in 2025 and 2050, we set a goal that four states in 2025 and 2025 of clean and renewable energy of four states accounted for 33\% of the proportion of total energy, respectively, of 39\%.Then we started with funding, technology and energy use, combined with the realities of the four states, and proposed four actions that might be taken to achieve the goal.
